# Netflix_Data_Set

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end analysis of the Netflix dataset using Power BI. The dataset includes information about movies and TV shows released on Netflix from 2008 to 2021, covering details such as title, genre, release year, rating, duration, cast, and country of origin.

The objective of this project was to explore content trends, audience targeting, and platform growth by transforming raw Netflix data into interactive dashboards. Through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, I built a report that helps answer critical questions like:

How has Netflixâ€™s content library grown over the years?

Which countries contribute the most to Netflixâ€™s catalog?

What type of content (Movies vs. TV Shows) dominates?

How are age ratings distributed across content?

ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques Used

Power BI Desktop â†’ Dashboard creation

Power Query â†’ Data cleaning & transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â†’ Custom measures & KPIs

Slicers & Filters â†’ Interactive analysis by year, rating, or type

ðŸ“Š Key Features of the Dashboard

ðŸ’¡ Insights Generated

Netflixâ€™s content library has grown rapidly since 2015, aligning with its global expansion.

Movies make up a larger share of Netflixâ€™s catalog, but TV Shows are steadily increasing.

The majority of content is from the United States and India, showing strong dominance in English and Hindi content.

TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings, reflecting Netflixâ€™s focus on adult and teen audiences.

ðŸš€ Value of This Project

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Clean and transform large datasets in Power Query
