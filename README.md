The objective of this project was to explore content trends, audience targeting, and platform growth by transforming raw Netflix data into interactive dashboards. Through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, I built a report that helps answer critical questions like:

1) How has Netflixâ€™s Rapidly grow from 2015?

2) Which countries contribute the most to Netflixâ€™s catalog?

3) What type of content (Movies vs. TV Shows) dominates?

4) How are age ratings distributed across content?

ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques Used

a) Power BI Desktop â†’ Dashboard creation.

b) Power Query â†’ Data cleaning & transformation.

c) DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â†’ Custom measures & KPIs.

d) Filters â†’ Interactive analysis by year, rating, or type.

ðŸ“Š Key Features of the Dashboard

1) Content Trends Over Time.

2) Number of releases per year (2008â€“2021).

3) Split between Movies and TV Shows.

ðŸš€ Value of This Project

This project demonstrates my ability to:

1) Clean and transform large datasets in Power Query.

2) Apply DAX formulas to generate measures and KPIs.

3) Design interactive and insightful dashboards for real-world datasets.

4) Communicate data stories effectively with visuals.

5) Itâ€™s a strong example of how data analytics can turn raw streaming data into meaningful insights about industry trends, audience targeting, and business growth.
